# How They Test

A collection of testing conventions and patterns used by prominent open-source ecosystems.

> **Note on attribution**: These docs describe conventions found in project codebases, not personal styles of individual developers. While project leads like Evan You and Tanner Linsley heavily influence architectural decisions, the testing patterns are shaped by entire core teams, community contributors, and years of evolution.
